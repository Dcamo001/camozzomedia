          Hello! I am a travel/outdoors photographer and videographer who
          currently resides in Berkeley, CA. Growing up in Herndon, Virginia, I
          spent much of my time outdoors exploring the woods and rivers
          surrounding my neighborhood and developed a love of adventure, nature,
          and exploration from a young age.
        </p>

          My interest in photography started when I received my first camera as
          a gift from grandparents just before a trip to Europe. From there, I
          sporadically picked up and put the camera down through the years until
          2015, when my family took a trip to Hawaii and I was overwhelmed by
          the colors and sights. I discovered that one of my passions is
          capturing and sharing the world as I see it in my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, Iâ€™ve spent nearly every weekend shooting all up and down
          the West Coast, mainly focusing on sharing landscapes and nature. My
          goal with this is pretty simple: to travel and enjoy the outdoors
          while inspiring people to get outside, appreciate their surroundings,
          and help to preserve them.
        </p>

          Lightroom, Photoshop (sparingly), and Davinci Resolve.
